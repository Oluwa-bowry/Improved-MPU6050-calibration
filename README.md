# Improved MPU6050 calibration

I have made some improvements to the original MPU-6050 calibration sketch by Luis RÃ³denas:
1. A check has been added if the MPU-6050 is not detected, so that the sketch does not continue to find the offsets.
2. It prints out the calibration offsets in a more practical format that you can directly copy and paste into your Arduino sketch.
